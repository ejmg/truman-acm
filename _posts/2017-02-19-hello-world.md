# New Website!

After some tweaking, screaming (joking), googling, and a few emails with Dr. Bindner, I got the website to render correctly on sand. 

For those who might be interested, the confusion I had was configuring the website to build off the right base url. Since this blog is built as a directory off of `sand.truman.edu` the base url is not the host itself, but the directory `/acm` itself. After generating the website with those configurations, the problem was solved.

Regardless, I hope everyone likes the new website for Truman's ACM chapter. I think it's a pretty good upgrade from before but all input is welcomed of course!
